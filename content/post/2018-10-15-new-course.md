This winter semester I am starting a new course on empirical methods in social sciences. The whole course will be based on using the R ecosystem. Students will learn R using RStudio and have access to a dedicated course room at [datacamp](http://www.datacamp.com). In addition, I'm developing `shiny` applications that will allow students to "play" with the data. 

All slides are generated using `xaringan` and the coursebook is being developed using bookdown. Even the final exam will be generated using R and the `exams` package.

I'm looking forward to this new course that provides massive amounts of material provided by the R community.
