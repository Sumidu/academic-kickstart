In the SmartIdentifikation project, a German-Austrian project consortium is addressing challenges of migration management in Austria and Germany, which have become increasingly important as a result of the 2015 / 16 refugee movement. In addition to the identification of individuals based on their smartphone data, the focus is on the recognition of (unaccompanied) minors and the identification and analysis of smuggling routes. In the context of these goals, the interdisciplinary project teams pursue ethical, legal and acceptance-relevant questions on an equal footing with the technical challenges and goals. The scientific and technical work objectives refer to the following aspects:

* Development of a system for systematic evaluation of smartphone data for the identification of individuals
* Determining the age of persons on photos and adaptation to the application for the detection of minor
* Development of tools for trend analysis and visualization of smuggling routes
* Interface for secure data exchange
* Processing of data protection issues with regard to the use of personal and private data
* Review and implementation of applicable ethical frameworks
* Analyzing the importance of privacy for citizens in a field study
