abstract = "Entropy, originating from statistical physics is a fascinating and challenging concept with many diverse definitions and various applications. Considering all the diverse meanings, entropy can be used as a measure for disorder in the range between total order (structured) and total disorder (unstructured), as long as by 'order' we understand that objects are segregated by their properties or parameter values. States of lower entropy occur when objects become organized, and ideally when everything is in complete order the Entropy value is zero. These observations generated a colloquial meaning of entropy."
