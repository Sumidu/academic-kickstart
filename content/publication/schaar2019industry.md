abstract = "Against the background of a digitalizing industry (industry 4.0) the question of how companies and future staff are prepared for these changes is becoming increasingly important. That is why the focus of this empirical-experimental study was put on the investigation of the choice of job of Millennials and their requirements on the ideal workplace. The perspective of high potentials within the group of Millennials was collected by means of two focus groups (n=8) which were carried out prior to the main study, a quantitative conjoint study (n = 165). By applying conjoint analysis, the study empirically investigated the relationship between the attributes job tasks, flexibility, family-friendliness, and salary."
